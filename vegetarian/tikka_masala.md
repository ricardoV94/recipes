### Ragout
- smaller amount of ginger grated (2 cm?)
- 2 cloves of garlic (originally 4)
- 1 big onion
- 2 spoons of butter
- ½ can of tomatoes
- 200 ml Coconut milk
- Salt
- 2 spoons of yoghurt

### naan
(makes 4 big pieces):
- 250 g flour
- 100 ml natur yoghurt
- ½ package dried yeast
- ½ package baking powder / sütőpor
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 80 ml water
- 1 spoon sunflower oil

## Instructions

For the naan, we mix the flour, yoghurt, yeast, baking powder, salt, water and oil. We make a homogeneous pasta out of it, form it into a ball, put flour on top and let it rise to twice the size (at least 1-2 hours).


We make the garam masala mix of the spices. To the chicken (tofu) we put 4 spoons of yoghurt, 2 grated garlics, and a big piece of grated ginger, we sprinkle it with 3 teaspoons of the masala spices, mix well and let it rest in the fridge (20 mim tofu, 1 hour chicken).

On a bit of oil, we cook a bit the onion cut into small pieces, the garlic, the grated ginger, and when they are nice and brown, we add 3 teaspoons of the masala mix, and cook it until it smells very good. Add the tomato can and let it thicken. 

Add the coconut milk, the extra yogurt and the tofu, salt and let it boil for some time.

If using chicken, we either prepare it in a separate pot, or prepare it before the onions and put aside, or we make them in the oven on 230 degrees until ready, once turning them. Cut before adding to the ragout. 

At the very end add 2 spoons of butter.


For the naan, knead the pasta once more, cut it in 4 equal parts and flatten it into a droplet shape. Cook it in non-stick pan (preferably covered), until bubbles form on the surface. Add coriander or garlic on top.
