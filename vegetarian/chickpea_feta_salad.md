# Chickpea - feta salad

1. 25 dkg chickpea (50 dkg if using canned one)
1. salt
1. 30 dkg feta cheese
1. 1 spoon római kömény / Roman cumin
1. 1 clove of garlic
1. 1 big bouquet of parsley
1. Quarter teaspoon cinnamon (can leave it out entirely!)
1. 5 spoons of olive oil
1. 2 spoon white wine vinegar

THE DAY BEFORE: wash the chickpeas, put 3 times as much water. Skip if using canned.

Take off the water from the chickpeas, put it cooking in clean, salty water (can add a bit of baking soda to the water). Cook it on low heat until it becomes soft (around 2 hours in a pot, but I think less). Take off water.

Precook the Roman cumin a bit, then crumble it (skip if using ground cumin). Peel the garlic, mince it. Wash the parsley, dry it.

Mix the chickpeas with the garlic, spices, add salt if needed (but the feta is salty). Put olive oil, vinegar, parsley, crumble the feta on top. Mix it well. Keep in fridge for 2-3 hours.
