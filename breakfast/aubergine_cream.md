# Aubergine cream

## Ingredients
- 2 aubergines
- 0,5 purple onion
- 2 cloves of garlic
- 3 tablespoon mayonnaise
- Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions
Wash the aubergines, poke their skin with a fork, and bake in one piece on 170 degrees for one hour (I cut them in half, and then poke the inside. I even put a bit of oil on it).
When it's done, wait for it to cool down a bit, then with a spoon, scrape it out of its skin, and put it in a blender.
Add the onion cut in pieces and the garlics smashed and blend until smooth.
Add salt and pepper to taste. Add the mayo when it's cold.
